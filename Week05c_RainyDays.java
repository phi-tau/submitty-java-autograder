/** 
Write a program RainyDays to compute and print the percentage of 
days of rain in a year. Ask the user to input the city, the year 
and the number or rainy days for that year. Print a message that 
includes the year and the percentage of days that were rainy.

Use a custom method called getRainyPercentage() that computes 
the percentage with the parameters:   
- year
- rainy days

E.g. What city?
Denver
What year?
2012
How many days of rain?
47
It rained 12.8767% of the year in Denver in 2012
